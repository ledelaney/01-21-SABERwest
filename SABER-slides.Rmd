hi there, i'm so glad to be here. today i'm going to talk to you about a project that i started in the Fall, examining how students think about complex questions regarding natural selection & adaptation.

real quick: my name is lucy, i'm a phd candidate in evolutionary biology. i'm going to fly through this today: but, more materials online (these slides and some resources), so plz feel free to reach out!

don't need to explain to this crowd how important understanding biological concepts is: can foster care&appreciation for the natural world, help to create empathetic&engaged citizens, bolster scientific&computational literacy... BUT...

## Biology education has a problem
<br>
<br>

--

🥱
Biology is &#8220;just memorization!&#8221;

???
i hear this regularly from my students: often feels this way, because biology is usually presented as a string of facts, devoid of connection! each course siloed as if it's a discipline all its own

--

😫
Why does this matter &mdash; &#8220;I just want to be a doctor!&#8221;
<br>


???
i also here critiques such as this: this suggests we're not always doing a great job demonstrating the value of a robust intellectual framework in biology!

--
🤯
Formal instruction is not always leading to robust conceptual understanding

???
for me teaching genetics, surprising pauctiy of aha moments happening -- students are having a hard time putting the facts together and finding the bigger picture...
i think we need to be providing a better framework and a better narrative structure throughout the course of study

???
the thing is, biology HAS a beautiful and compelling framework and narrative! and a lot of work over the last few decades suggests that evolution-centered teaching can help with these issues

BUT if we want to get to the summit that is understanding evolution there's a long path to traverse...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain2

???
first, we all need to speak the same words...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain3

???
then we need to use those words to understand basic individual-level biological processes like DNA replication... 

---
class: middle, bg_mountain4

???
now we can begin to talk about the environment and ecology...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain5

???
then, we must start thinking about randomness, probability, and timescale: what processes may yield over millions of years...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain6

???
now we are about ready to bring in evolutionary mechanisms, which conceptually bring their own challenges...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain7

???
we must learn to distinguish the pattern from the process that generates it...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain8

???
and finally, we must distinguish levels of causality, functional and evolutionary (not mentioning correlation/causation, another talk)
given these two final stages, i set out to answer some questions

 `r emo::ji("yarn")` How do students construct biological explanations across levels of instruction?  


--
 `r emo::ji("chart_with_upwards_trend")` Does instruction improve outcomes?
 

???
first: four classes from 100- to 400-level
gave two weeks to answer five open-ended questions for homework, allowed to use resources and cite
completed once in the first two weeks of classes and once in the last
coded responses based on the following framework...

## Preliminary Takeaways

--

↪️
Most common explanations invoke Final and/or Efficient causality (i.e., ultimate pattern or proximate process) and shift regularly around these between pre-post
<br>

↪️
Formal instruction is not nudging students toward Formal causality
<br>

↪️
Students invoking Formal causality in both assignments are more likely to have more biology credits <br> (_p-value_ = 0.06)
<br>
<br>

## Questions

1. How best to display this data?

2. Best methods for analyzing categorical data of this kind?

3. Any general feedback!
