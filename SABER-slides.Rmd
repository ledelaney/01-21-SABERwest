hi there, i'm so glad to be here. today i'm going to talk to you about a project that i started in the Fall for my dissertation, examining how students think about complex questions regarding natural selection & adaptation.

Biology is `r htmltools::HTML("&ldquo;")`just memorization!`r htmltools::HTML("&rdquo;")`

Momsen _et al._, 2010]

one of the most common critiques from students i hear is this: 
it often feels this way, because biology is usually presented as a string of facts, devoid of connection! each course siloed as if it's a discipline all its own

i also here critiques such as this: 
this suggests to me that we're not always doing a great job demonstrating the value of a robust intellectual framework in biology!

for me teaching genetics, surprising paucity of aha moments happening -- students are having a hard time putting the facts together and finding the bigger picture...

i think we need to be providing a better framework and a better narrative structure throughout the entire course of postsecondary study

the thing is, biology HAS a beautiful and compelling framework and narrative! and a lot of work over the last few decades suggests that evolution-centered teaching can help with issues of both conceptual understanding and value...

BUT if we want to get to the summit that is understanding evolution there's a long path to traverse... no time to discuss each step in the journey, but going to focus on the last two

biology is of course an experimental science, but it is also a historical science -- variation is generated by changing a part of parts of something that already existed through the process of mutation or recombination. these processes do create from scratch.

️Need to evaluate both proximate and ultimate processes responsible for pattern]


???
BUT, not only can different processes produce the same pattern, but there are also both "proximate" (or functional) and "ultimate" (evolutionary) processes responsible for a given pattern. for instance, there's the individual that makes the scarf -- but why did they make the scarf? presumably because we have necks and those necks get cold.

and research shows that in individual biology courses we spend a tremendous amount of time on the "proximate" or "functional" processes and proportionally less time on the "ultimate" or "evolutionary" processes. this makes conceptual understanding of evolution -- and i would argue, biology in general! -- nearly impossible.

given these two final stages of conceptual understanding -- pattern vs process and proximate vs ultimate causality -- i set out to answer some questions

How do students construct biological explanations across levels of instruction?  (used four classes from 100-400 level)

Does instruction improve outcomes? (pre-post design)

students had two weeks to answer five open-ended questions for homework, allowed to use resources -- once in the beginning of the semester and once at the end
coded responses based on the following framework...

-formal cause ultimate-process (THE ANSWER WE WANT!): environmental heterogeneity + biological tradeoffs over large timescales

and what we were looking for in the students' responses is the FORMAL cause -- the ultimate process responsible, the full evolutionary history of the trait and organism

coded responses based on what level of explanation the student addressed in response (sometimes more than one)

so here is an example of some idealized data:
R1 response 1, R2 response 2... and the idealized case is that after formal instruction they are all nailing formal causality in their responses

class: middle, left, bg_reality_v2

but this is what we really see... this is currently binned by the number of earned biology credits... and it's a bit of a mess! there's no real clear pattern here: many students actually move away from formal causality after instruction or more often never get there at all

## Preliminary Takeaways

↪️
Most common explanations invoke Final and/or Efficient causality (i.e., ultimate-pattern or proximate-process) and shift regularly around these between pre-post
`r htmltools::withTags(br())`

↪️
Formal instruction is not nudging students toward Formal causality
